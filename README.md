# Google PlayStore Data Analytics


## Functionalities

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive data analysis of Google Play Store information using PySpark, Databricks, and machine learning techniques. Key functionalities include:


- Data cleaning and exploration.
- Creating a Microsoft Azure cluster using Databricks for distributed computing.
- Storing and processing large amounts of data on the Distributed File System on Databricks.
- Developing a PySpark-based machine learning model for predicting the number of installs per price.


## Architecture & Design

For effective computing, the project makes use of Microsoft Azure's Databricks cluster in a distributed architecture. PySpark is used for machine learning model creation, analysis, and data cleansing. Matplotlib along with Seaborn are used to generate visualizations.


## Deployment Instructions

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/itisgj/Google-PlayStore-Data-Analytics.git`
2. Set up a Microsoft Azure account and create a Databricks cluster.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook or script containing the project code on Databricks.
4. Execute the code cells or run the script to perform data analysis and build the machine learning model.


## Steps to Run the Application

1. Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed.
2. Set up your Databricks environment with the required configurations.
3. Execute the code sequentially or run the entire notebook/script.


## Test Results

Test results for the machine learning model's performance, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) or other relevant metrics, can be found in the project's output or logs.
